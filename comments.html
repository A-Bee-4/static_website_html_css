              Aside from using google fonts we've used variable font sizing,
              fairly new CSS function <code>clamp</code> which allows us to have

          possible. Here are some points outlining some of the features that
          make this website more readily accessible.

            The pages are W3C validated, with no errors or any warnings. W3C
            validation has many enduring advantages, such as extending the
            lifespan of the website pages, maintaining browser compatibility,
            search engine performance, device compliance and much more.
          </li>
          <li>
            the "alt" attribute has been set on all images to give users with
            visual impairments a general idea of what the image is about without
            actually having to see the image.
          </li>
          <li>
            The text used on the web page contrasts highly with the background
            colour, which also makes it easier for user to read the information
            on the page. The page title is large and the menu items are clear
            and succinct on the page.
          </li>
          <li class="pb-1">
            Relative font sizes are used for all textual elements of the page,
            so that the users may freely resize the text on their browser using
            their cleints zoom controls.

            <p>
              Throughout our site we've used many techniques to ensure
              consistency, we've made the use of CSS variable to store all
              colors used throughout the website, this helps with consistency of
              design and reduce amount of duplicate code.

          <div class="pb-1 pt-1">
            <h3>Spacing</h3>
            <p>
              To keep the spacing in this design consistent and boost our
              development, we've created pre defined classes spacing, this not
              only helps us in early stage of designing but long term this
              reduces code duplication.

            <h3>Colour Contrast</h3>
            <p>
              Particular attention has been paid to colour contrast when
              designing the aesthetics of the website. Colour combinations that
              do not strain the eye are used throughout the website. The website
              has been tested for color contrast using
